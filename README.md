# Lazy Scroller

Lazy Scroller is a technology demonstration developed for the Fullstack Academy Stackathon (individual 4-day hackathon). It uses the [clmtrackr][clmtrackr_link] javascript library to detect the exact location of a user's nose when seating in front of a computer. These coordinates are then used to determine how much should a web page scroll when a user moves the head up or down.

The main objective of this project was to develop an app that would be useful when a user is eating in front of the computer with the hands dirty, and wants to read an article, but does not want to touch the keyboard.
